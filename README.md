## To-Do:

> Add settings panel

> Implement terminal emulation support

> Add compiler/code-running functionalities based on current project language

> Create a welcome splash screen for the end user's ease of access.

> Track current problems in dedicated/individual user messages to eventually display in a pane dedicated to project errors, warnings, and output.

> Add event listening for modified files that are not yet saved, along with traditional indicators to display to the user. Along with this, if a file is unsaved display a "quit confirmation" message before the user can quit the application.
